Q's:
STS history of normativity? "Normative configurations" "normative positions" normativity v.s. constructivist
STS history of engagement? 
PUSS surfeit?

escape binaries

## Intro

3 binarism of learning or acting, but never both
4 we're acting so please stop thinking
5 experimental production of knowledge; fear of over and under involvement; experimental production of normativity
6 increase in demand for impact and also distanced objectivity; engaged scholarship
7 merely critiquing objectivism is risky; is engagement just a return to the idea that we are a special class who can change things in a-moral ways?;
9 Difference between consultants and sociological work is the former try to find new solutions within a given problem space and the latter try to determine if the boundaries of the problem space can be productively altered
10 list of approaches where he thinks engagement isn't problematic
11 question of if accurately documenting behavior considered bad is helpful to the people who behave that way or simply assists in targeting them; How can sociologists acknowledge their desire to change things for the better without compromising their work
12 Becker article demands that work, whoever it benefits, be done to a good standard and sympathies don't invalidate the work
13 Sociology often is called biased because it tries to ignore the current social hierarchy, which looks agenda'd
14 If taking things from one side on purpose is bad, would we ever proceed from the underdog's standpoint?
17 Do what do we engage with?
19 Intervention is not the result of engagement, but is essential for finding certain kinds of knowledge
20 experiments not as things to answer questions, but to pick a direction; Experimentation may overcome social scientist 
21 Important to remember that intervention cannot be seen as a cleanly seperated outside and inside where the outside is unchanged by intervening "inside"
22 Engagement should try to avoid the topic / resource dichotomy?
23 Shifting away from the topic of engagement means that our intervention becomes situated
24 STS is inescapably entangled because its goal is inherently more useful to outsiders; idea that STS is captive to these vulnerable populations
25 Our models may be outdated; who do we join with?
26 Intervention could reconnect STS to its activist roots by making our normative goals explicit, but this reintroduces the risk of working without boundaries instead of working /on/ the boundaries.
27 In the medical field intervention can be seen as part of the diagnostic process; intervention does not need to have a normative aim, but rather can produce information about the situation
28 power / knowledge dichotomy a badly posed question, fixes the relationship between the ideas;
29 situated knowledges ðŸ˜Ž; Escapes from fiddly questions of how much and can focus on being connected and grounded in the field you work; material re-figurations do not lend themselves to reproducible methodology
30 STS interventions often discursive dispite the focus on material qualities; book explores material reconfigurations; STS focus on discourse probably partially about the kinds of practices STS focuses on; there is a risk of positing a material / discrusive divide, no his goal
35 rarely obvious how to get results out of interventions

All the major themes here seem very useful to my project, or at least to framing it within the discipline of STS. The idea of being able to escape, or at least have a different relationship to, the question of learning and acting (a thing I've been having trouble articulating) is great. I also think the framing of intervention as diagnostic tool is perfect and fits really well with my experience as a software engineer - we too intervene to diagnose. Generally into the idea of situating myself in the project before embarking, but that begs the question of how to situate myself. We'll see I suppose. Other key ideas is to contextualize my intervention with the sociality of software (makenzie) and talk about what I am going into and what I'm not going into and how I think about those lines. 


## Conclusion
179 Concern in STS that a normative position can lead to fascism because it validates an a-priori value hierarchy or moral relativism
180 We must cast our lots with some and not with others, which is enabled by simply throwing up absolute epistemological authority
182 Again calls out limiting actions to discourse
183 remember that we intervene into already sorted places; We don't want to hand-wave at "context" but we also don't want to ignore it; you are always in a context and you should attend to that context and what it brings with it while avoiding a freezing in framing of what is possible, though you should remember that those who are creating the context are trying to freeze some qualities and change others
184 Intervention effectiveness limited by the views of powerful actors in author's space
185 Don't let you lack of experience in all areas from believing in the value you can bring in some areas
186 Managers like management consultants because they reinforce the manager's world view; STS's devotion to changing boundaries may leave it permanently seen as less plainly valued
187 Artful contamination - entangle sociological practices with domain practices productively
189 <unsure>
190 It's ok to live in uncertainty and entanglement as long as we are reaching for understanding what would be a good idae
191 Our understanding of normativity must be open to the possibility of future correction or we are unhealthy; situated intervention biologically inspired; attend to the specific ethics for the situation encountered; situated intervention

Woo. This was some tough sledding. For 45 or so pages that was a lot of work and very dense. Very good though.

I think this will do great for situating my work around intervention and justfying that in a STS frame. Looking back at my notes I'm not sure if I missed things. There's a lot in here about concerns about normative values, a term and idea that I'm not familiar with in STS contexts. Certainly I know norms, but generating norms? I was a bit lost. I think it's likely that what this book is worried about is an issue I will come up against or want to talk about but I don't know how much more I got out of the conclusion over just the intro.

That said, I think the idea of using the skills I *do* have and being attentive but not shy because there are skills I don't have. Also very into the idea of digging into things and getting entangled in them and that entanglement being a benefit to producing knowledge.
