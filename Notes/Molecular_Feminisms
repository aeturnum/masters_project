## Intro

2 Erotic as...motive force that exist within us and drive us to do things
3 How is feminism held back by the difficulty of interacting productively with the representations of biology that come out of technoscience?; What if we could use the practices of technoscience to expand rather than contact?; How do we engage productively with other systems of knoweldge?
4 Expand molecular biology to other zones of action
9 politics of sameness vs difference; difference not as a...specific shift in qualities but as a discrete character of an entity
10 feminist critiques: aperspectival objectivity does not exist, reductions are not as simple as they seem, binary thinking sucks, essentialism is everywhere, linear logic hides complexity
11 early feminist critiques in egalitarian frameworks
12 did not develop alternatives to reductionism, just critiqued it
13 New conversion of themes around ethics, materialism and epistemological practices
14 molar vs molecular less about size and more about the perspective of engagement
15 molar - being, identiy, fixedness; molecular - becoming, nomadism, potential; essential to preserve the ability to strategically invoke identity in a stable group (a molar practice)
16 <grab bag of concepts I should look into>
17 Asserting the value of scientific practices, even if they're infected with 
19 How to assemble the table 
20 Approach the sciences from below; Bring ourselves down to the level of grass
21 What is possible if we think simultaneously along two different lines?

## Biophilosophies of Becoming

2 How can we change our orientation towards a diverse range of forces that constitute our bodies; world is perceived and actualized by nonhuman act-ants
3 question the limits of our understanding of the human subject; not all epistemologies are equal,  not everyone an equal knower; cost of knowing if it is forced through a single western system of knowledge
4 western traditions place greater and lesser values on different ways of knowing and being that comes from the belief that there is a single way of arriving at a given idea (?); mythical norm of me, basically - unmarked but good; what questions are asked of and about bodies?
5 what do non-human beings do and what are they capable of doing?
6 Frame thoughts in terms of processes and becoming
7 frame properties and qualities in terms of becoming and events
8 becoming as way of seeing positive differences; escape from binarism; Let us try to reduce the distance between us and grass
9 ontological univocity - all things exist in the same way and thus can be considered in the same terms; How do we think about difference without assigning value to those differences?
10 biophilosophy of becoming - changefullness and non-human beings, kinship and the belief that all things are alive, univocity and imminence
12 ability to take things lightly and play with ideas as really only being true for europeans and wealthy westerners; haecceity - the qualities of a particular individual event that make it distinguishable from other events of its type: the timing, the qualities, the unique quirks of that particular time something happened
14 ontological univocity not uniquely western
15 extending the idea of what is alive and therefor what can have agency or desires; understand "life" as the potential to differ; Seeking to escape from a human frame of things

Is this expanding the idea of life or arguing that life is not a useful or interesting idea?

General idea of - the idea of living or non-living ignores the fact that, whatever your life status, you live in a world where you have material interactions with other things and that your existance depends on those interactions and that those interactions form a network that supports all other things in the interactions and that to start from some technical definition of life or death is pre-judging the importance and qualities of a thing because of what we imagine living and non-living things things to have or be.

16 awareness of other nonhuman experiences is not focused on changing our interactions as such but on broadening our understanding of what interactions can be useful and interesting and productive and natural beyond simple binarisms
17 To classify in the way that we do in taxonomies is to deny the possibility for change
18 An ethics of encounter; We must look for and recognize the way in which all forms of matter express certain capacities and are hylozic (alive in some sense)
19 About making connections in new ways to find new ways to respond and be with other things in the world

## Microphysiologies of Desire

4 Metaphor of "jumping generations" in feminist thought to avoid needing 
5 stolonic patterns of growth have no center
6 molecular and molar are not opposed, but simply different approaches
8 particular fields of science have been more involved in constructing women / poc / the disabled as less valuable members of society
10 not about ignoring humans
13 feminist practice does not mean turning away from matter or biology or data
14 Bohr's point is that things don't have qualities as such at all times inherently, but that things have qualities in measurement scenarios
16 Depublishing as withdrawing material reality
17 Reproduction failed when conditions that were not considered important for the first experiment changed; want microphilosophies of desire that allow the knower to operate on the same plane of existence as the thing that will become known
19 Haraway's relentless becoming-with on ontological kin
20 getting lost, learning to work in the ruins; problematize the "one who knows"; learning to live with and make peace with ambiguity and unknowing and speak about a definite solid form of a shifting, multitudinous unclear mass of possibilities
21 The purpose of getting lost is to ignore the destination and focus on the question of how to move forward; How can we work with the science we are disappointed in?
22 must find moments of perplexity to share with other scientists; ideas without risk to the thinker are uninteresting; science is not about truth but about pursuing interests; must abandon the search for "truth" and instead seek imminant critique and joint perplexity
24 Ethics about taking responsibility for our own influence and presence in the becomings in which we are all always involved.
25 living and nonliving can respond; desire is the general force of forging connections rather than an emotion (H2 desires O); Feeling around and touching a fundimentally unknowable other

## Bacterial Lives

2 Bacteria sex!
3 We need a broader understanding of sex - a genetic mixing process that may have nothing to do with reproduction; mutual aid
4 Bacteria gender understood through genetic contribution
6 Need to move on from the 2nd wave idea that places sex in nature and gender in culture into a vision where both are engaged in both fields; materiality of organisms like bacteria are constitutive of scientific knowledge
8 How to isolate "sex" as it's not clear "sex" exists in a fixed place in any particular way?
10 Use of binary sex and gender in science reify these inappropriate divides; the idea of interaction pre-supposes the existance of two realms
11 agental realism and its focus on process-phenomenon-measured-things
12 Bioloigy is not external to culture
13 Biopossibility: a biologically-enabled ability to embody or forward socially relevant traits of ways of being
15 Bodies as active part of the process;
17 Sex as an event and not as a sable factor within a binary
21 Material things communicate in a language too, you know
22 Biological engagment as langauge; life is encryption
25 Materiality that is inaccessible through language; should we include bactera as a writer?; How far does that go? Can bacteria write poetry?
26 There is nothing outside context
27 baterial writing considered with: colonialsim and imperialism, capitalism & commodification, gendered / raced labor and repdoduction of it, neoliberal individuality and imperialism, technology; Bacteria are themselves semiotic, but humans only see that through bacterial labor
28 Where does reificiation end and innovation begin when working with bactera?
29 Neoliberalism reworks value of life by refiguring boundaries of what is life

## Should feminists Clone?

1 all becomings already molecular; our bodies and thier components can be made to work against the categories they are seen to exist within
2 poststructuralist ethics - what are our duties to others?
3 What happens when we can make kin with bacterial writers?
4 If we're positifists, then biologists are really working on Nature; Who cares if it's an original?
7 When tropes work they turn our attention; strategic mimiesis is a simulation that doesn't essentailize an original, merely use it for its effects
9 Sub / FEM / Cloning: isolate dilemma, ligate delemma to figuration vectors, transform, analyze connections, collect reconfigurations
10 seek to be an outsider/insider marginal knower hyphanated-cyborg; hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) seen as hierarchy
11 Mapping inexorably caught up in the materiality of what the map is mapping
12 Envisioning social justice and change by bringing togther things that need not collide so they do collide and reveal tension; fetus / chip / gene / race/ database / etc as harayway stem cell of technoscience knowledge; 
14 Develop a feeling for organisms; new reproductive technologies have already changed how we live
16 Pregnancy reveals barbarity of circumstances that one must operate under 
17 Reconsider relationship to technology and other factors that have been historically disvalued because they are read as forcing women to become mothers
18 What does humanity really mean if bacteria can write? 
19 Womans bodies as interchangable parts for technoscience; women animals and plants have all beeen forced to become comodities
21 She won't name trump! How much do we believe in this research on stem cells?
22 Women used as resouce for both sides of the stem cell debate; conservatives place women above animals but how far above and which women?
24 Become a monster that exists between worlds and can ask questions
25 Give up being a judge; don't be trapped in the idea that technology allows us to escape responsibility

## In Vitro Incubations

1 Only though time in the lab did the author find time to think about the complexity of the assemblage
2 cell cultivation as history of relation to life; hypothesis is not necessary - the material qualities of cells can suggest discoveries
4 Challenges of aknowledging the alive and deepning out ties to them; 
5 What does it mean to be a life?
6 Must keep the costs of interventions in mind and remain comitted to justice for all forms of life
8 Must have approaches that don't start with assessing correctness, but simply engaging in the material of the field and looking for things of use
9 Univocity key to the idea that multitudinous life can exist in a single ontological field
10 Some clarifications on deleuze:
Previous ontologies would see difference as emerging from other, more fundimental aspects of being. Like - you were different but that difference proceeded from the difference from what you were and what other things where. The qualities of being had no difference and were foundational. Deleuze wants to flip that on its head and question if these foundational identities that other systems claim exist can exist at all or be identified at all and wants to claim that it is the difference that allows us to imagine the qualities at all.
Still do not understand imminence? "Existing within"?
11 vitalism?; Life best understood as situated within a field of supportive and disruptive elements not on its own
12 Assemblages!; hetrogenious couplings of organic and inorganic progressing processes that create machines that function and progress
13 life is both a specific set of things and processes that are "alive" as well as the potential for things to be pulled apart into composite parts by complex systems and taken from one context to another context (which is not to say "out of context" for that would pre-suppose context); STS scholars should see themselves as part of the assemblage that includes synthetic life
14 Central dogma of flow from DNA -> RNA -> Protein; Crick doesn't believe in religious beliefs?
15 Crick misunderstanding of term has implications; 
16 Central dogma has guided the approach to biology and synthetic biology for generations, like any other a-priori belief
18 Definition of life has shifted from the things within an organism born of another organism to the synthetic life that is assembled outside of a traditional reprodutive context
19 Life of the molecule; Minimal genomic organism involves a "traditional" organism that has a new genome placed in it - creating a life assemblage
20 Bacteria as machine; life too complicated to study
21 Not sure what the full circle is here? A return to interactive systems?
22 alloplastic reactions create new content and expressions; <rough sentence bottom>
24 Really absurd dickering about using an organism that is associated with an STI
25 Company founded to produce new source for malaria treatment 
27 We live in an unjust world and must be careful not to forward that unjustice
28 Searching for an algae to make gas;

I don't follow how the qualities that we've been focusing on (univocity, hylozicism) play into these straightforward stories of capital exploitation of life for purposes that don't help the life

29 Conflation of alternative fuels and oil companies; issues of national control over lifeforms in their borders

## Conclusion

Maybe this is all about horizontal social movements

## Discussion

What are the applications of this work?
Lines of flight deleuzian concept

"gwatari"

Heard about the book at 4S 
- What is an event? - becoming 
The human question


Philosophical framing of how to frame doing lab work and material and "molecular" work 

Deleuze and Gottori totally full of themselves apparently 

Pedagogical and translational nature of the work 

stolons vs rzyomes - going straight up vs spreading out - <?> vs wide power
