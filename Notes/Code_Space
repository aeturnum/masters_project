# Code/Space

Kitchin, Rob, and Martin Dodge. Code/space: Software and Everyday Life. MIT Press, 2011.

## Intro

3 code is everywhere
4 though invisible, produces tangible effects
5 power drawn from its codifying powers, possesses secondary agency 
5 capta
6 Coded Objects: Things that only have meaning because code. e.g. DVD
6 Coded Infrastructures: link together coded objects, monitored by software. e.g. networks
6 Coded Process: processes that involve the flow of capta across Coded Infrastructure. e.g. ATM 
7 Coded Assemblage: intersection of Coded Infrastructures that produce a different space than either on its own; e.g. hospital
9 Everyware - software, enabled by cheap bandwidth and prices, mediates all aspects of life
11 software produces interpolation - where people make themselves subjected to it in return for its advantages
11 network society - a society that can shift structurally because the relationships that are possible have been changed by networks
13 Must understand software spatially
16 Code / Space is where space is co-constituted between software and real objects
17 Places can be "transduced" into code/spaces though the use of connections to the wider network
17 code/spaces can be territorialized or deterritorialized
18 coded space is one where code enhances but is not essential to the space.
19 code/space reproduces relational power structures

## 4 Transduction of Space

65 space is particular and shapes the things that happen in it
66 ontogenetic concept of space? code/space is ontogenetic; space previously understood as natural and given; a grid in which things occurred
67 Space does not exist pre-formed and waiting for meaning, but are created by diverse practices that help determine the meaning of the space
69 fully Heraclitian understanding of space, things must be endlessly renewed and reconfirmed to be space
71 Space is a doing, enacted through our interactions with others 
71 Code/space created through various practices and processes
72 Transduction is the creation of a new, temporary (as is all space) space through a transition from another space. Problems (getting to a store) are solved through a series of transductions involving individual choice that creates new spaces (moving from block to block) while each problem falls away to be replaced by another new one that is smaller or that is new (moving a shorter distance to the store or getting back home).
72 software catalyzes transduction
74 Spaces can be code/spaces without constant software interaction.
77 Scale is not euclidian space either, but is socially constructed and emerges out of understandings. We see scale when we try to make sense of the world and use it as a metaphor to talk about how we do or should encounter the world. code/spaces often cut across scales.
79 Power is enacted through contingent and diverse individual acts of many actors and does not come from a single source or a single mind, they are supported by regimes of discourse that inform and constraing conversation, the nature of power is unfixed but also ever present and real

This articulates an understanding of space as emerging out of constantly shifting and individualized actions by the actors who make up that space. It also brings scale into this ontology as a metaphor that emerges out of trying to make sense of this constantly shifting space. That is not to say that space isn't consistent or predictable or active, but that it is that way because of the constant individual action of many actors who do things that maintain the nature of that space. This doesn't *directly* relate to my topic, but it feels like it will be a really useful framing device for understanding the kind of space generated by EDEN and I think it will be useful in explaining how software, which may not physically exist in a given place, helps create the sapce at that place. The idea of space being "transduced" by code is actually a little underdeveloped I think? But I think it will be a useful metaphor and tool for talking about how EDEN impacts things (again) and how we see code acting on the world.

## 5 Automated Management

81 software transforming existing biopolitical regime
82 New technologies make people calcuable and direct and police their actions
84 Oligopticon - a localized field of total surveillance that can only see in a limited area
85 management is automated, automatic and autonomous
86 new survaliance not anbout self discipline, but about objectifying individuals for active control. societies of controlesq. Individual worlds are altered based on data captured, often in small and mundane ways ("social credit")
87 capture model of control; capture inherent in interaction and exterts direct force on the user immediately; capta is generated for many purposes; 
90 Systems of capture allow freedom within allowed grammers, which allows the internet to feel "freeing" and also to be a system of capture
90 capta shadow - the capta that is, rightly or wrongly, associated with you in a capture model
91 Capta have largely replaced and expanded older forms of observation and dissemination and exist in searchable digital databases which are widely accessible; ironically, retrieving data from these database is an act that will generate capta
92 Increasing focus on exact and reliable identification of people in various space and the ability to trace everything
98 The more extreme the power dynamic, the more likely capta are to be required. Capta is very cheap to store and is thus collected opportunistically
99 monitoring is incrasingly mobile and continious, it also takes advantages of networks to manage capta from afar
101 Storage is cheap
103 Capta is processed into new knowledge 
104 Code uses capta to judge risk and allow or disallow
106 Automated management supported by a field of discursive strategies about how increased monitoring increases our safety
107 The argument that these technologies make us safer, true or not, is unarguably promulgated by powerful actors 

This isn't a very theory heavy chapter and probably won't be that useful to me? The idea of oligopticons - limited fields of knowledge - might come up, but they're not very developed. Idea of capta and capta shadow (though I'm not sure I agree with their choice of metaphor) will probably be used, but I'm not sure I got a lot out of reading this chapter. This feels very much like a "so you know biopolitics" chapter for people who aren't already familiar with digital systems. It is interesting to me that they felt they *should* write this chapter, because all of it felt given to me and actually answered some questions I had about what was biopolitics and what had kind of...evolved post-foucault.
