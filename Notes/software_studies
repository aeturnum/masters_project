# Software Studies: a lexicon

Fuller, Matthew. Software Studies: A Lexicon. MIT Press, 2008.

## intro
2 assembly
4 software immateriality; materiality
6 self-suffiency fosters disfunction

## algorithm
15 unifying abstraction; have material existance and effect
17 algorithms do things; foucault statement
19 not sure if side effect is the right phrase here

algorithms as material actors and as theoritical manipulations of ideas. 

## analog
25 feedback loop
26 once formed, easy to project backwards and understand many previous ideas as involving feedback

## button

## code
40 codes are universal

## codecs
50 code reogranized images; desire to avoid referencing technical media
52 software linked to thought
53 motion prediction nothing like film frames; motion prediction key to compression

details of how compression works and how that compression "works" on images and a bit on how the kinds of content that work well and the kinds of content that work poorly are determined by the cultural goals of moving pictures.

Also does not cite any sources when describing how MPEG-2 "works"

## computing power
55 computing power as a kind of wealth and power

## concurrent versions system
65 cvs central coordinating point
(does site technical sources)
66 wiki comes from cvs ideas; code creation social; how does FLOSS actially work
67 cvs as discursive relationship; software constructed!
(no citations of any sort to justify description)

## copy
71 copy routine added to computers early
72 basic operation of moving data around in registers; meme theory makes all civilization based on copies

## data visualization *
79 visualizations imply that machines can't be fully trusted on their own

## elegance
88 problem complexity measured through size of program that solves it
89 idea of elegance allows analysis of programming; no formal proof of elegance
90 elegance outside of programming could be understand as simple structures that link together / cross heterogenous others

## ethnocomputing

## function
101 programming civic minded, hope to avoid repitition
(also does not)
104 math functions can't be executed; can be understood as a lookup table
105 inputs must always map to same outputs if the function is rational
106 Repeatability; cannot infer input from output

## glitch

## import / export
119 move data between apps; la does a lot of importing?
120 importantance of import and export in software & media

## information
