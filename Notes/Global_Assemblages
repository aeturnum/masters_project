# Intro

3 Social phenomenon increasingly identified with uncommon and heterogeneous units of analysis
4 Not interested in cataloging structural transformations - interested in the form those transformations take; They are abstractable, dynamic, mobile and acting across traditional boundaries of "society", "culture", and "economy"; assemblages are sites for Rabinow's anthropological problems; Example of stem cell research - it happens in particular places and in particular ways, but it is always understood to have the potential to be universal. That imaginery of the universal is betrayed by the specific ways and places and things which assemblages are constituted from
5 In spite of the universal possibilities, stem cells spread along the lines of global capital and scientific expertise; us restrictions on stem cells invokes a humanism that has definite limits to its scope
7 social technologies that control through visibility and discipline; 
8 Social structures are technology and deciding how to structure that technology; reflexivity involves a lot of different people in a lot of different positions - many of them elite;
9 But the significance in reflexivity comes from its wide applicability; Global assemblages!; Giddens emphasizes the importance of global forms in modern institutions 
10 rational is not positive in this text; 
11 global phenomena can uniquely move across and through "cultural" barriers; global standards require large, systemic changes that cut across social and political boundaries to produce information that is useful to the relevant authorities; organ trade (could also talk about subrananium's use of wombs in india that cross caste lines)
12 biomedical frame given more legitimacy than other sources of adversity in society; ethical problems that relate to biological life can become global in nature and be seen as a collective political concern (Chinese praised for management of population growth and criticized for controlling birth); concepts to make complex infrastructure tractable; Assemblages are not just "localities" and assemblages are not just structural effects; *They are the product of multiple things that cannot be reduced; 
13 Significance of the organ trade for a person is based in theire relative location in the assemblage; 
14 shifts are sometimes demanded because technical modes of action break down, which lead to different frames being applied; specific historical, political and economic understanding where issues become problems; 
15 Trajectories of change that don't reflect some kind of new global reality, but are material changes in how particular parts of the world "work" that push on other things; Seeks to sidestep the questions about global changes by favoring talking about specific changes in specific areas
16 Citizenship as an accumulation of the stuff of life; People have speculated that we are at the end of what people have called "globalization" and there are building reactions to it;
17 Globalization has shifted from economic to terrorist-aligned processes; *assemblages close to practices; difficult to tell, in these complex times, how to use global narratives; 

Assemblages are specific ways of being and doing that are historically, politically and technologically defined. They are composed of a group of actants, almost always human and nonhuman, who are also unequally involved with the process. Though we can look at assemblages as individual things, they can't usefully be reduced to a single entity.
