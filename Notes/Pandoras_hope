## One - "Do You Believe in Reality"?

2 science studies as threat to science; is science studies not part of science?
3 Maybe science studies is pulling new people into science who might be left outside; What STS people see as adding realism to science is seen, by scientists, as reducing its power of truth
4 Descart's cogito posed in an environment where we can't be sure of our own bodies, limiting its impact on science studies; Belief in reality as similar to the belief in god that descart uses to get out of the cogito; Do you need god? Maybe the world gives us enough information on its own
5 New ideas about brains and stimuli had brains directly interpreting stimuli, but the stimuli didn't have enough information to actually reconstruct the ideas; The solution is to abandon the idea of certainty and instead say we certainly have access to some of reality; the minds pre-designed categories give form to the confusing and insufficient mix of stimulus; The mind is now in control and the world simply tells the mind what is happening
6 We keep universality within the limited sphere of empiric science; Mind from the vat builds world; Fear of popular vision of what is "real" determining what is real
8 The mind is still trapped in the vat, for all of the work we've done on improving how we see the situation
9 Phenomenology deals with the world-as-experienced-by-humans; Creates a world of science that has no human qualities or elements and a world of humans that is totally experiential and has no material qualities whatsoever; Why not just admit that we experience life as a part of a wholistic, containing natural experience?
10 Because this would undermine the structural categories that hold up scientific efforts!; Mob rule is the second concern about not believing in reality
11 Must consider the might of the mob - how do we deal with it?; Smart people are worth more than dumb people!
12 Power of reason puts someone above all others; Why do we even need the idea of an outside world?; Why are we trying to rely on a single brain to be absolutely certain instead of relying on connections to be communally certain?
13 Use of perfect observation used to allow us to avoid mob rule and so we can avoid being brutish and ugly; World must be totally exterior to avoid mob rule;
15 Central concern of epistemology is stability and asserting dominance over others; Science studies doesn't need these things because it's not concerned with asserting an absolute and dominating truth; 
17 Why don't people believe in science studies?; It's situated between two cultures; stronger science is science that is more firmly connected to the social; 
19 New mixed sciences are struggling to apply the old rules 
20 Science (cold, objective, needed) v.s. Research (open-ended, uncertaiin, practical); Research a collective effort between humans and nonhumans to find
21 Science studies can look like relativism and a claim there's no truth; postmodern vs nonmodern

## A Collective of Humans and Nonhumans

174 Greeks distinguised reason (epestime) from know-how (metis)
175 Engineers cannot take unmediated action; daedalion as model / metaphore for the collective (perception?)
176 Heidegger thinks man is totally possessed by technology; technology dominates science; Heidegger is wrong - no one is mastered by anthing
177 NRA believes the gun does nothing in of itself; materialist places all blame on the gun for wrongs; sociological reasoning neuters the artifact of its power - all comes from the weilder
178 mediation 1 - a program of action - a series of goals; a third agent is created by combining gun and holder; new agent has a new goal that's not available to either participating agent - translation; 
179 translation is the creation of a link that did not exist before; you are different with a gun in your hand
181 Each new combined agent is created by a new daedalion, which creates a new subprogram; The story is that the agent gets a new thing to solve its problems; Doesn't weaken the power of other actors to give prime mover status to one actor; Action is a property of acrant
182 Goal is preserved, but actant changes as we move through sub-programs; Pointing out the pimary mover doesn't reduce the actions of the other actants; symmetry is the part of the goal that lasts through these transformations; We don't need the dialectical 
183 Breakdowns reveal the black boxes that make up black boxes; Failure creates a social situation where the object has more properties; Goes through different steps
185 Known or unknown, they continue to act; nonhumans are neither objects seen by subjects 
186 Techniques have material impacts, not just the discursive identitity; crosses the boundary between signs and things; This is a change in the manner of expression, but it's not a different goal; We need a new name for this
187 We will call it delegation - you delegate something to the material
188 Many shifts: of actors (from engineer to bump) from an action to something that always exists; How does this shifting work? It's true that going somewhere physically and going somewhere 
189 Transportation can be understand as an act of delegated transformation where the movement is "shifted down" into a black box that's been designed by engineers; Objects stand in for absent actors; We are surrounded by objects that have others' intentions encoded into them; ***Technology as congealed labor;
190 Goal is to make the invisible labor that exists within machines 
191 Technology doesn't really exist outside of humans; technique can be seen in the deviations from the goal (in sub-programs) before ultimately returning to the original goal; technical roles are subordinant because they exist to enable other goals; technical is a hitch or catch in the program; technical skills create obligatory passage points
192 "technical" is a particular kind of delegation where heterogenious things are tied together; Humans depend on technology to act and to become actors - humans cannot act as isolated humans
193 Things are always supported by networks of knowledge, material support and planning that belies the idea that something "just exists"; These things happen within a "collective" where human and nonhuman properties are exchanged within a corporate body for "society"; forget societies we're in collectives now!
194 We want to avoid subject-object disctinctions when talking about humans and nonhumans; **lots of definitions here, translation, crossover, enrollment, mobilization, displacement; 
195 science and technology do not allow us to "exceed" the limits of society, they extend them; modern society translates and mobalizes more material things into their social fabric than societies that don't have as much technology
196 Modern societies have a more intimate weaving of relationships; access to technology HIGHLY mediated; many more people are involved in each thing than used to be
199 Society is constructed but it's not socially constructed - there is material force behind the bonds; "science wars" are people who insist that we are heading backwards and mixing the objective (nonhuman) and the subjective (human)
200 science studies has humans and objects growing ever closer together as time advances; confusion of humans and non-humans in past and future; Wants to show that we CAN (not that we must) avoid the central object / subject dichotomy 
206 nonhumans have a capacity to relate to things that they are made to relate to,  understanding them as relationships makes sense; Industry is kind of the level of machines interacting with each other?
207 Need a "megamachine" (a large organization of planning, command, logistics) - not a machine per-se; As we learn more about managing humans, we endow nonhuman actants with that learning 
210 Before society, nonhumans stabalize social situationsa and negotiations
