@BOOK{Roy2018-ma,
  title     = "Molecular Feminisms: Biology, Becomings, and Life in the Lab",
  author    = "Roy, Deboleena",
  abstract  = "�Should feminists clone?� �What do neurons think about?� �How
               can we learn from bacterial writing?� These provocative
               questions have haunted neuroscientist and molecular biologist
               Deboleena Roy since her early days of research when she was
               conducting experiments on an in vitro cell line using molecular
               biology techniques. An expert natural scientist as well as an
               intrepid feminist theorist, Roy takes seriously the expressive
               capabilities of biological �objects��such as bacteria and other
               human, nonhuman, organic, and inorganic actants�in order to
               better understand processes of becoming. She also suggests that
               renewed interest in matter and materiality in feminist theory
               must be accompanied by new feminist approaches that work with
               the everyday, nitty-gritty research methods and techniques in
               the natural sciences.By practicing science as feminism at the
               lab bench, Roy creates an interdisciplinary conversation between
               molecular biology, Deleuzian philosophies, science and
               technology studies, feminist theory, posthumanism, and
               postcolonial and decolonial studies. In Molecular Feminisms she
               brings insights from feminist and cultural theory together with
               lessons learned from the capabilities and techniques of
               bacteria, subcloning, and synthetic biology to o er tools for
               how we might approach nature anew. In the process she
               demonstrates that learning how to see the world around us is
               also always about learning how to encounter that world.",

  title     = "The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the
               Politics of Technical Expertise",
  author    = "Ensmenger, Nathan L",
  abstract  = "The contentious history of the computer programmers who
               developed the software that made the computer revolution
               possible.This is a book about the computer revolution of the
               mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible.
               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed
               the ``computer boys'' were taking over, not just in the
               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society
               in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger
               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and
               women (a surprising number of the ``computer boys'' were, in
               fact, female) who built their careers around the novel
               technology of electronic computing explores issues of power,
               identity, and expertise that have only become more significant
               in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the
               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally
               human development.",

  author    = "Subramaniam, Banu",
  abstract  = "In a stimulating interchange between feminist studies and
               biology, Banu Subramaniam explores how her dissertation on
               flower color variation in morning glories launched her on an
               intellectual odyssey that engaged the feminist studies of
               sciences in the experimental practices of science by tracing the
               central and critical idea of variation in biology. As she shows,
               the histories of eugenics and genetics and their impact on the
               metaphorical understandings of difference and diversity that
               permeate common understandings of differences among people exist
               in contexts that seem distant from the so-called objective hard
               sciences. Journeying into areas that range from the social
               history of plants to speculative fiction, Subramaniam uncovers
               key relationships between the life sciences, women's studies,
               evolutionary and invasive biology, and the history of ecology,
               and how ideas of diversity and difference emerged and persist in
               each field.",
