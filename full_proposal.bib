  author    = "Roy, Deboleena",
  abstract  = "�Should feminists clone?� �What do neurons think about?� �How
               can we learn from bacterial writing?� These provocative
               questions have haunted neuroscientist and molecular biologist
               Deboleena Roy since her early days of research when she was
               conducting experiments on an in vitro cell line using molecular
               biology techniques. An expert natural scientist as well as an
               intrepid feminist theorist, Roy takes seriously the expressive
               capabilities of biological �objects��such as bacteria and other
               human, nonhuman, organic, and inorganic actants�in order to
               better understand processes of becoming. She also suggests that
               renewed interest in matter and materiality in feminist theory
               must be accompanied by new feminist approaches that work with
               the everyday, nitty-gritty research methods and techniques in
               the natural sciences.By practicing science as feminism at the
               lab bench, Roy creates an interdisciplinary conversation between
               molecular biology, Deleuzian philosophies, science and
               technology studies, feminist theory, posthumanism, and
               postcolonial and decolonial studies. In Molecular Feminisms she
               brings insights from feminist and cultural theory together with
               lessons learned from the capabilities and techniques of
               bacteria, subcloning, and synthetic biology to o er tools for
               how we might approach nature anew. In the process she
               demonstrates that learning how to see the world around us is
               also always about learning how to encounter that world.",

  abstract  = "What identity means in an algorithmic age: how it works, how our
               lives are controlled by it, and how we can resist it Algorithms
               are everywhere, organizing the near limitless data that exists
               in our world. Derived from our every search, like, click, and
               purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see,
               the information accessible to us and even who our friends are.
               These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social
               relationships in the digital and physical world, but also
               determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.
               Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and
               reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status.
               They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists.
               In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data
               collection entails more than gathering information about us.
               Entities like Google, Facebook, and the NSA also decide what
               that information means, constructing our worlds and the
               identities we inhabit in the process. We have little control
               over who we algorithmically are. Our identities are made useful
               not for us---but for someone else. Through a series of
               entertaining and engaging examples, John Cheney-Lippold draws on
               the social constructions of identity to advance a new
               understanding of our algorithmic identities. We Are Data will
               educate and inspire readers who want to wrest back some freedom
               in our increasingly surveilled and algorithmically-constructed
               world.",

@BOOK{Dean2010-lk,

  abstract  = "Blog Theory offers a critical theory of contemporary media.
               Furthering her account of communicative capitalism, Jodi Dean
               explores the ways new media practices like blogging and texting
               capture their users in intensive networks of enjoyment,
               production, and surveillance. Her wide-ranging and theoretically
               rich analysis extends from her personal experiences as a
               blogger, through media histories, to newly emerging social
               network platforms and applications. Set against the background
               of the economic crisis wrought by neoliberalism, the book
               engages with recent work in contemporary media theory as well as
               with thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean Baudrillard, Guy
               Debord, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj ?i?ek. Through these
               engagements, Dean defends the provocative thesis that
               reflexivity in complex networks is best understood via the
               psychoanalytic notion of the drives. She contends, moreover,
               that reading networks in terms of the drives enables us to grasp
               their real, human dimension, that is, the feelings and affects
               that embed us in the system. In remarkably clear and lucid
               prose, Dean links seemingly trivial and transitory updates from
               the new mass culture of the internet to more fundamental changes
               in subjectivity and politics. Everyday communicative
               exchanges{\~N}from blog posts to text messages{\~N}have
               widespread effects, effects that not only undermine capacities
               for democracy but also entrap us in circuits of domination.",

               feminist theorist Donna J. Haraway offers provocative new ways
               to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its
               inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the
               Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls
               the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch
               as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked
               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,
               requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis,
               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and
               dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to
               the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building
               more livable futures. Theoretically and methodologically driven
               by the signifier SF---string figures, science fact, science
               fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, so

  abstract  = "The contentious history of the computer programmers who
               developed the software that made the computer revolution

               mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible.
               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed
               the ``computer boys'' were taking over, not just in the
               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society
               in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger
               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and
               women (a surprising number of the ``computer boys'' were, in
               fact, female) who built their careers around the novel
               technology of electronic computing explores issues of power,
               identity, and expertise that have only become more significant
               in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the
               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally
               human development.",

               sciences in the experimental practices of science by tracing the
               central and critical idea of variation in biology. As she shows,
               the histories of eugenics and genetics and their impact on the
               metaphorical understandings of difference and diversity that
               permeate common understandings of differences among people exist
               in contexts that seem distant from the so-called objective hard

               evolutionary and invasive biology, and the history of ecology,
