% It is generally worthwhile, I think, to justfiy the use of LaTeX. It's obtuse 
% and it's difficult and it's unclear that it's any better than using Word for
% most projects. However, it has one advantage: it is generated from plain text 
% and this project is using Git, a tool that talks plain text. 
% 
% Using LaTeX will let me create a relaibly formatted document and also have an
% intelligable history of changes. It will also let me work on this document (and
% presumably my final paper which will also use LaTeX) in any environment. It's also
% nice to have a language with comments that won't render into the final paper for
% items like this.

   \section*{Overview}
   % Overview (0.5-1 page)
   % A summary of other sections of the proposal
   \subsection*{Description}
   Mapping EDEN is an experiment in wedding sociological critique with a craft-tradition of Computer Science seeking artifacts and ways of making and doing that suggest fresh approaches to multiple disciplines.
   % A one line description of the project
   \subsection*{Background}
   % Background / context for project / articulation of contemporary problem being addressed
   Ideally, the goal of Science, Technology and Society is to do work that is fully engaged with the practical details of human experience and effort and uses that engagement to develop theoretical understandings that reveal new points of contact and analyses. \citet{Sismondo2008-xz} describes this ideal as an “engaged program” that seeks to use pertinent topics in theoretically interesting ways. This project attempts to realize these qualities by simultaneously applying theoretical critiques to a situated and particular software tool and modifying that tool in conversation with those critiques. The end goal is a process-object that exists both as a fully functional piece of software and a record of the progress towards analyzing and creating that software from an existing base. I chose this particular form because it draws from both the traditions of software development and Science, Technology and Society scholarship but sets neither above the other. An engaged product must strive to be fully available to more than just the scholars of the social sciences.
   \subsection*{Merits}
   % 2-3 intellectual merits (informs research questions)
   Primarily, this project grew out of a sense of the disconnect between the making and doing of Science, Technology and Society and the making and doing of engineering. This approach was inspired the approaches of \citet{Roy2018-ma} and \citet{Subramaniam2014-wg} in working to learn more through their combination of the scientific method with feminist critique. My project is not one centered on feminist critique, but within my own background of craft Computer Science \citep[see]{Ensmenger2012-kz} and
