               important theoretical and political issues haunting contemporary
               theories of technology: the opposition of the ?digital? to the
               ?real.? This fundamentally misrepresents the relationship
               between the online and offline, in both directions. First, it
               flies in the face of the myriad ways that the online is real.
               Second (and just as problematically), it implies that everything
               physical is real. Work in the ontological turn can help correct
               this misrepresentation regarding the reality of the digital.
               However, this potential contribution is limited by conceptions
               of difference the ontological turn shares with the interpretive
               frameworks it turns against. Drawing on ontological-turn

               techniques of William James's radical empiricism. How has
               wirelessness--being connected to objects and infrastructures
               without knowing exactly how or where--become a key form of
               contemporary experience? Stretching across routers, smart
               phones, netbooks, cities, towers, Guangzhou workshops, service
               agreements, toys, and states, wireless technologies have brought
               with them sensations of change, proximity, movement, and
               divergence. In Wirelessness, Adrian Mackenzie draws on
               philosophical techniques from a century ago to make sense of
               this most contemporary postnetwork condition. The radical
               empiricism associated with the pragmatist philosopher William
               James, Mackenzie argues, offers fresh ways for matching the
               disordered flow of wireless networks, meshes, patches, and
               connections with felt sensations. For Mackenzie, entanglements
               with things, gadgets, infrastructures, and services--tendencies,
               fleeting nuances, and peripheral shades of often barely
               registered feeling that cannot be easily codified, symbolized,
               or quantified--mark the experience of wirelessness, and this
               links directly to James's expanded conception of experience.
               ``Wirelessness'' designates a tendency to make network
               connections in different times and places using these devices
               and services. Equally, it embodies a sensibility attuned to the
               proliferation of devices and services that carry information
               through radio signals. Above all, it means heightened awareness
               of ongoing change and movement associated with networks,
               infrastructures, location, and information. The experience of
               wirelessness spans several strands of media-technological
               change, and Mackenzie moves from wireless cities through
               signals, devices, networks, maps, and products, to the global
               belief in the expansion of wireless worlds.",

  abstract = "Social media platforms and mobile phone data are commonly mined
              to produce accounts of how people are responding in the aftermath
              of crisis events. Yet social and mobile datasets have limitations
              that, if not sufficiently understood and accounted for, can
              produce specific kinds of analytical and ethical oversights. In
              this paper, we analyze some of the problems that emerge from the
              reliance on particular forms of crisis data, and we suggest ways
              forward through a deeper engagement with ethical frameworks and a
              more critical questioning of what crisis data actually
              represents. In particular, the use of Twitter data and
              crowdsourced text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane
              Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake raised questions about the ways in
              which crisis data act as a system of knowledge. We analyze these
              events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical
              perspectives and assess the challenges of data collection,
              analysis and deployment. While privacy concerns are often
              dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms such
              as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information

              support---present ongoing risks. We argue for a deeper
              integration of critical data studies into crisis research, and
              for researchers to acknowledge their role in shaping norms of

               addressing constitutional questions on the issue, we propose a

               system can lead to unmeasurable biases in both risk scores and
               outcome measures. The final layer engages conceptual problems

               ``Indispensable.''A powerful investigative look at data-based
               discrimination---and how technology affects civil and human
               rights and economic equity The State of Indiana denies one
               million applications for healthcare, foodstamps and cash
               benefits in three years---because a new computer system
               interprets any mistake as ``failure to cooperate.'' In Los
               Angeles, an algorithm calculates the comparative vulnerability
               of tens of thousands of homeless people in order to prioritize
               them for an inadequate pool of housing resources. In Pittsburgh,
               a child welfare agency uses a statistical model to try to
               predict which children might be future victims of abuse or
               neglect.Since the dawn of the digital age, decision-making in
               finance, employment, politics, health and human services has
               undergone revolutionary change. Today, automated
               systems---rather than humans---control which neighborhoods get
               policed, which families attain needed resources, and who is
               investigated for fraud. While we all live under this new regime
               of data, the most invasive and punitive systems are aimed at the
               poor.In Automating Inequality, Virginia Eubanks systematically
               investigates the impacts of data mining, policy algorithms, and
               predictive risk models on poor and working-class people in
               America. The book is full of heart-wrenching and eye-opening
               stories, from a woman in Indiana whose benefits are literally
               cut off as she lays dying to a family in Pennsylvania in daily
               fear of losing their daughter because they fit a certain
               statistical profile.The U.S. has always used its most
               cutting-edge science and technology to contain, investigate,
               discipline and punish the destitute. Like the county poorhouse
               and scientific charity before them, digital tracking and
               automated decision-making hide poverty from the middle-class
               public and give the nation the ethical distance it needs to make
               inhumane choices: which families get food and which starve, who
               has housing and who remains homeless, and which families are
               broken up by the state. In the process, they weaken democracy
               and betray our most cherished national values.This deeply
               researched and passionate book could not be more timely.",

  abstract  = "A revealing and surprising look at how classification systems
               can shape both worldviews and social interactions.What do a
               seventeenth-century mortality table (whose causes of death
               include ``fainted in a bath,'' ``frighted,'' and ``itch''); the
               identification of South Africans during apartheid as European,
               Asian, colored, or black; and the separation of machine- from
               hand-washables have in common? All are examples of
               classification---the scaffolding of information
               infrastructures.In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and
               Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in
               shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they
               investigate a variety of classification systems, including the
               International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing
               Interventions Classification, race classification under
               apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and
               of tuberculosis.The authors emphasize the role of invisibility
               in the process by which classification orders human interaction.
               They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how
               people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also
               explore systems of classification as part of the built
               information environment. Much as an urban historian would review
               highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city's story, the
               authors review archives of classification design to understand
               how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral
               agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of
               view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce
               advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions
               benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and
               how we think about that process are at the moral and political
               core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for
               understanding the building of information infrastructures.",

               lives are controlled by it, and how we can resist it Algorithms
               are everywhere, organizing the near limitless data that exists
               in our world. Derived from our every search, like, click, and
               purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see,
               the information accessible to us and even who our friends are.
               These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social
               relationships in the digital and physical world, but also
               determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.
               Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and
               reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status.
               They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists.
               In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data
               collection entails more than gathering information about us.
               Entities like Google, Facebook, and the NSA also decide what
               that information means, constructing our worlds and the
               identities we inhabit in the process. We have little control
               over who we algorithmically are. Our identities are made useful
               not for us---but for someone else. Through a series of
               entertaining and engaging examples, John Cheney-Lippold draws on
               the social constructions of identity to advance a new
               understanding of our algorithmic identities. We Are Data will
               educate and inspire readers who want to wrest back some freedom

               to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its
               inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the
               Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls
               the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch
               as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked
               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,
               requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis,
               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and

               cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and
               practices that have transformed not only software but also
               music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of
               practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software
               source code that is made openly and freely available through an
               unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these
               specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around
               the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of
               knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to
               discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by
               demonstrating how Free Software is a ``recursive public''---a
               public organized around the ability to build, modify, and
               maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first
               place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an
               Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in
               Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the
               technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers,
               geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case,
               he shows how their practices and way of life include not only
               the sharing of software source code but also ways of
               conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses,
               coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in
               detail how these practices came together as the Free Software
               movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how
               it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from
               Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit
               organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a
               project to create an online scholarly textbook commons.",

               the emergence of a community dedicated to the production of free
               and open source software--and to hacking as a technical,
               aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of
               contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political
               significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS)
               movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details
               the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes
               that guide its production, and the political struggles through
               which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and
               patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book
               unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of
               access, and intellectual property. E. Gabriella Coleman tracks
               the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate
               manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and
               festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers
               sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these
               activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key
               ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and
               refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman
               demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or
               misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of
               liberalism in online collaboration.",
