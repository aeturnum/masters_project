  author    = "Zuiderent-Jerak, Teun",
  abstract  = "An exploration of sociological research that is neither
               ``detached'' nor ``engaged''; a new approach to sociological
               knowledge production, with examples from health care.In this
               book, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak considers how the direct involvement
               of social scientists in the practices they study can lead to the
               production of sociological knowledge. Neither ``detached''
               sociological scholarship nor ``engaged'' social science, this
               new approach to sociological research brings together two
               activities often viewed as belonging to different realms:
               intervening in practices and furthering scholarly understanding
               of them. Just as the natural sciences benefited from broadening
               their scholarship from theorizing to experiment, so too could
               the social sciences. Additionally, Zuiderent-Jerak points out,
               rather than proceeding from a pre-set normative agenda,
               scholarly intervention allows for the experimental production of
               normativity. Scholars are far from detached, but still may be
               surprised by the normative outcomes of the interactions within
               the experiment.Zuiderent-Jerak illustrates situated intervention
               research with a series of examples drawn from health care. Among
               the topics addressed are patient compliance in hemophilia home
               care, the organization of oncology care and the value of
               situated standardization, the relationship between
               standardization and patient centeredness, the development of
               patient-centered pathways, value-driven and savings-driven
               approaches to the construction of health care markets, and
               multiple ontologies of safety in care for older adults. Finally,
               returning to the question of normativity in sociological
               research, Zuiderent-Jerak proposes an ethics of specificity
               according to which research adapts its sociological responses to
               the practices studied. Sociology not only has more to offer to
               the practices it studies; it also has more to learn from them.",

  author    = "Boellstorff, Tom",
  abstract  = "Millions of people around the world today spend portions of
               their lives in online virtual worlds. Second Life is one of the
               largest of these virtual worlds. The residents of Second Life
               create communities, buy property and build homes, go to
               concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services,
               buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall
               in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered
               through a computer screen. At the time of its initial
               publication in 2008, Coming of Age in Second Life was the first
               book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate
               universe. Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of
               fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its
               residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally
               have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the
               so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar
               ``Tom Bukowski,'' and applied the rigorous methods of
               anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human
               life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and
               antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the
               interplay of self and group.Coming of Age in Second Life shows
               how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society.
               Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this
               book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been
               virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity
               build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as
               humanity itself. Now with a new preface in which the author
               places his book in light of the most recent transformations in
               online culture, Coming of Age in Second Life remains the classic
               ethnography of virtual worlds.",

  abstract  = "An analysis of the ways that software creates new spatialities
               in everyday life, from supermarket checkout lines to airline
               flight paths. After little more than half a century since its
               initial development, computer code is extensively and intimately
               woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. From the digital
               alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that
               guides our plane in for a landing, software is shaping our
               world: it creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and
               automates existing practices, transforms social and economic
               relations, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal
               empowerment, and modes of play. In Code/Space, Rob Kitchin and
               Martin Dodge examine software from a spatial perspective,
               analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The
               production of space, they argue, is increasingly dependent on
               code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of
               code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices,
               and caf{\'e}s that are transformed into workspaces by laptops
               and wireless access. Kitchin and Dodge argue that software,
               through its ability to do work in the world, transduces space.
               Then Kitchin and Dodge develop a set of conceptual tools for
               identifying and understanding the interrelationship of software,
               space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with
               rich empirical material. And, finally, they issue a manifesto,
               calling for critical scholarship into the production and
               workings of code rather than simply the technologies it
               enables--a new kind of social science focused on explaining the
               social, economic, and spatial contours of software.",

               questions have haunted neuroscientist and molecular biologist
               Deboleena Roy since her early days of research when she was
               conducting experiments on an in vitro cell line using molecular
               biology techniques. An expert natural scientist as well as an
               intrepid feminist theorist, Roy takes seriously the expressive
               capabilities of biological �objects��such as bacteria and other
               human, nonhuman, organic, and inorganic actants�in order to
               better understand processes of becoming. She also suggests that
               renewed interest in matter and materiality in feminist theory
               must be accompanied by new feminist approaches that work with
               the everyday, nitty-gritty research methods and techniques in
               the natural sciences.By practicing science as feminism at the
               lab bench, Roy creates an interdisciplinary conversation between
               molecular biology, Deleuzian philosophies, science and
               technology studies, feminist theory, posthumanism, and
               postcolonial and decolonial studies. In Molecular Feminisms she
               brings insights from feminist and cultural theory together with
               lessons learned from the capabilities and techniques of
               bacteria, subcloning, and synthetic biology to o er tools for
               how we might approach nature anew. In the process she
               demonstrates that learning how to see the world around us is
               also always about learning how to encounter that world.",

               increases in technological complexity, our understanding of it
               diminishes. Underlying this trend is a single idea: the belief
               that our existence is understandable through computation, and
               more data is enough to help us build a better world. In reality,
               we are lost in a sea of information, increasingly divided by
               fundamentalism, simplistic narratives, conspiracy theories, and
               post-factual politics. Meanwhile, those in power use our lack of

               are everywhere, organizing the near limitless data that exists
               in our world. Derived from our every search, like, click, and
               purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see,
               the information accessible to us and even who our friends are.
               These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social
               relationships in the digital and physical world, but also
               determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.
               Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and
               reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status.
               They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists.
               In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data
               collection entails more than gathering information about us.
               Entities like Google, Facebook, and the NSA also decide what
               that information means, constructing our worlds and the

               capture their users in intensive networks of enjoyment,
               production, and surveillance. Her wide-ranging and theoretically
               rich analysis extends from her personal experiences as a
               blogger, through media histories, to newly emerging social
               network platforms and applications. Set against the background
               of the economic crisis wrought by neoliberalism, the book
               engages with recent work in contemporary media theory as well as
               with thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean Baudrillard, Guy
               Debord, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj ?i?ek. Through these
               engagements, Dean defends the provocative thesis that
               reflexivity in complex networks is best understood via the
               psychoanalytic notion of the drives. She contends, moreover,
               that reading networks in terms of the drives enables us to grasp
               their real, human dimension, that is, the feelings and affects
               that embed us in the system. In remarkably clear and lucid

               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed

               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally

  abstract  = "A February 2014 iteration of Facebook?s software upgraded the
               number of options for gender identification from 2 to 58.
               Drawing on critical theoretical approaches to technology, queer
               theory, and insights from science and technology studies, this
               iteration is situated within a 10-year history of software and
               user modifications that pivot around gender. I argue that the
               gender binary has regulated Facebook?s design strategy while the
               co-existence of binary and non-binary affordances has enabled
               the company to serve both users and advertising clients
               simultaneously. Three findings are revealed: (1) an original
               programming decision to store three values for gender in
               Facebook?s database became an important fissure for non-binary
               possibilities, (2) gender became increasingly valuable over
               time, and (3) in the deep level of the database, non-binary
               users are reconfigured into a binary system. This analysis also
               exposes Facebook?s focus on authenticity as an insincere yet
               highly marketable regulatory regime.",

  title     = "Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software",
  author    = "Kelty, Christopher M",
  abstract  = "In Two Bits, Christopher M. Kelty investigates the history and
               cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and
               practices that have transformed not only software but also
               music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of
               practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software
               source code that is made openly and freely available through an
               unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these
               specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around
               the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of
               knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to
               discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by
               demonstrating how Free Software is a ``recursive public''---a
               public organized around the ability to build, modify, and
               maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first
               place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an
               Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in
               Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the
               technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers,
               geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case,
               he shows how their practices and way of life include not only
               the sharing of software source code but also ways of
               conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses,
               coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in
               detail how these practices came together as the Free Software
               movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how
               it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from
               Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit
               organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a
               project to create an online scholarly textbook commons.",

@BOOK{Cox2013-zo,
  title     = "Speaking Code: Coding as Aesthetic and Political Expression",
  author    = "Cox, Geoff and McLean, Christopher Alex",
  abstract  = "The aesthetic and political implications of working with code as
               procedure, expression, and action. Speaking Code begins by
               invoking the ``Hello World'' convention used by programmers when
               learning a new language, helping to establish the interplay of
               text and code that runs through the book. Interweaving the voice
               of critical writing from the humanities with the tradition of
               computing and software development, in Speaking Code Geoff Cox
               formulates an argument that aims to undermine the distinctions
               between criticism and practice and to emphasize the aesthetic
               and political implications of software studies. Not reducible to
               its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability
               inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only
               interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of
               operations. Code is understood as both script and performance,
               Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language--always
               ready for action. Speaking Code examines the expressive and
               performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream
               development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the
               organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise
               of social media and their actual role in suppressing political
               expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for
               free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language
               against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues
               to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may
               seem in an era of pervasive computing.",

               flower color variation in morning glories launched her on an
               intellectual odyssey that engaged the feminist studies of
               sciences in the experimental practices of science by tracing the
               central and critical idea of variation in biology. As she shows,
               the histories of eugenics and genetics and their impact on the
               metaphorical understandings of difference and diversity that
               permeate common understandings of differences among people exist
               in contexts that seem distant from the so-called objective hard
               sciences. Journeying into areas that range from the social
               history of plants to speculative fiction, Subramaniam uncovers
               key relationships between the life sciences, women's studies,
               evolutionary and invasive biology, and the history of ecology,
               and how ideas of diversity and difference emerged and persist in
               each field.",
