# Mapping EDEN

### What is this Git Repository?
This is the running log of my masters project for The Center for Science, Technology and Society at Drexel University. It's a critical analysis and modification of the EDEN software package. 

Eventually, this will be organized into an archive that's more navigable, but for now it's all just going to hang out. Feel free to look around!

## Presentation

There is no simple way to host a google presentation on github (and I don't want to upload a binary ball) so here is a sharing link:
