               feminist theorist Donna J. Haraway offers provocative new ways
               to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its
               inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the
               Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls
               the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch
               as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked
               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,
               requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis,
               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and
               dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to
               the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building
               more livable futures. Theoretically and methodologically driven
               by the signifier SF---string figures, science fact, science
               fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, so
               far---Staying with the Trouble further cements Haraway's
               reputation as one of the most daring and original thinkers of
               our time.",

  author    = "Kitchin, Rob and Dodge, Martin",
  abstract  = "An analysis of the ways that software creates new spatialities
               in everyday life, from supermarket checkout lines to airline
               flight paths. After little more than half a century since its
               initial development, computer code is extensively and intimately
               woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. From the digital
               alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that
               guides our plane in for a landing, software is shaping our
               world: it creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and
               automates existing practices, transforms social and economic
               relations, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal
               empowerment, and modes of play. In Code/Space, Rob Kitchin and
               Martin Dodge examine software from a spatial perspective,
               analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The
               production of space, they argue, is increasingly dependent on
               code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of
               code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices,
               and caf{\'e}s that are transformed into workspaces by laptops
               and wireless access. Kitchin and Dodge argue that software,
               through its ability to do work in the world, transduces space.
               Then Kitchin and Dodge develop a set of conceptual tools for
               identifying and understanding the interrelationship of software,
               space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with
               rich empirical material. And, finally, they issue a manifesto,
               calling for critical scholarship into the production and
               workings of code rather than simply the technologies it
               enables--a new kind of social science focused on explaining the
               social, economic, and spatial contours of software.",

  abstract  = "The contentious history of the computer programmers who
               developed the software that made the computer revolution
               possible.This is a book about the computer revolution of the
               mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible.
               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed
               the ``computer boys'' were taking over, not just in the
               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society
               in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger
               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and
               women (a surprising number of the ``computer boys'' were, in
               fact, female) who built their careers around the novel
               technology of electronic computing explores issues of power,
               identity, and expertise that have only become more significant
               in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the
               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally
               human development.",
