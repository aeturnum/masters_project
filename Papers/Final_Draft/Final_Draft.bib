               to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its
               inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the
               Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls
               the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch
               as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked
               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,
               requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis,
               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and
               dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to
               the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building

               in everyday life, from supermarket checkout lines to airline
               flight paths. After little more than half a century since its
               initial development, computer code is extensively and intimately
               woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. From the digital
               alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that
               guides our plane in for a landing, software is shaping our
               world: it creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and
               automates existing practices, transforms social and economic
               relations, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal
               empowerment, and modes of play. In Code/Space, Rob Kitchin and
               Martin Dodge examine software from a spatial perspective,
               analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The
               production of space, they argue, is increasingly dependent on
               code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of
               code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices,
               and caf{\'e}s that are transformed into workspaces by laptops
               and wireless access. Kitchin and Dodge argue that software,
               through its ability to do work in the world, transduces space.
               Then Kitchin and Dodge develop a set of conceptual tools for
               identifying and understanding the interrelationship of software,
               space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with
               rich empirical material. And, finally, they issue a manifesto,
               calling for critical scholarship into the production and
               workings of code rather than simply the technologies it
               enables--a new kind of social science focused on explaining the
               social, economic, and spatial contours of software.",

               developed the software that made the computer revolution

               mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible.
               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed
               the ``computer boys'' were taking over, not just in the
               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society
               in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger
               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and
               women (a surprising number of the ``computer boys'' were, in
               fact, female) who built their careers around the novel

               identity, and expertise that have only become more significant
               in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the
               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally
               human development.",

               remarkable argument for understanding the reality of science in
               practical terms. In this book Latour, identified by Richard
               Rorty as the new ``b{\^e}te noire of the science worshipers,''
               gives us his most philosophically informed book since Science in
               Action. Through case studies of scientists in the Amazon
               analyzing soil and in Pasteur's lab studying the fermentation of
               lactic acid, he shows us the myriad steps by which events in the
               material world are transformed into items of scientific
               knowledge. Through many examples in the world of technology, we
               see how the material and human worlds come together and are
               reciprocally transformed in this process. Why, Latour asks, did
               the idea of an independent reality, free of human interaction,
               emerge in the first place? His answer to this question, harking
               back to the debates between Might and Right narrated by Plato,
               points to the real stakes in the so-called science wars: the
               perplexed submission of ordinary people before the warring
               forces of claimants to the ultimate truth.",

  abstract  = "An exploration of sociological research that is neither
               ``detached'' nor ``engaged''; a new approach to sociological
               knowledge production, with examples from health care.In this
               book, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak considers how the direct involvement
               of social scientists in the practices they study can lead to the
               production of sociological knowledge. Neither ``detached''
               sociological scholarship nor ``engaged'' social science, this
               new approach to sociological research brings together two
               activities often viewed as belonging to different realms:
               intervening in practices and furthering scholarly understanding
               of them. Just as the natural sciences benefited from broadening
               their scholarship from theorizing to experiment, so too could
               the social sciences. Additionally, Zuiderent-Jerak points out,
               rather than proceeding from a pre-set normative agenda,
               scholarly intervention allows for the experimental production of
               normativity. Scholars are far from detached, but still may be
               surprised by the normative outcomes of the interactions within
               the experiment.Zuiderent-Jerak illustrates situated intervention
               research with a series of examples drawn from health care. Among
               the topics addressed are patient compliance in hemophilia home
               care, the organization of oncology care and the value of
               situated standardization, the relationship between
               standardization and patient centeredness, the development of
               patient-centered pathways, value-driven and savings-driven
               approaches to the construction of health care markets, and
               multiple ontologies of safety in care for older adults. Finally,
               returning to the question of normativity in sociological
               research, Zuiderent-Jerak proposes an ethics of specificity
               according to which research adapts its sociological responses to
               the practices studied. Sociology not only has more to offer to
               the practices it studies; it also has more to learn from them.",
