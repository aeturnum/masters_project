               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,

               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and

               in everyday life, from supermarket checkout lines to airline
               flight paths. After little more than half a century since its
               initial development, computer code is extensively and intimately
               woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. From the digital
               alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that
               guides our plane in for a landing, software is shaping our
               world: it creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and
               automates existing practices, transforms social and economic
               relations, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal
               empowerment, and modes of play. In Code/Space, Rob Kitchin and
               Martin Dodge examine software from a spatial perspective,
               analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The
               production of space, they argue, is increasingly dependent on
               code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of
               code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices,
               and caf{\'e}s that are transformed into workspaces by laptops
               and wireless access. Kitchin and Dodge argue that software,
               through its ability to do work in the world, transduces space.
               Then Kitchin and Dodge develop a set of conceptual tools for
               identifying and understanding the interrelationship of software,
               space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with
               rich empirical material. And, finally, they issue a manifesto,
               calling for critical scholarship into the production and
               workings of code rather than simply the technologies it
               enables--a new kind of social science focused on explaining the

               mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible.
               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed

               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society
               in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger
               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and

               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally

               remarkable argument for understanding the reality of science in
               practical terms. In this book Latour, identified by Richard
               Rorty as the new ``b{\^e}te noire of the science worshipers,''
               gives us his most philosophically informed book since Science in

               analyzing soil and in Pasteur's lab studying the fermentation of
               lactic acid, he shows us the myriad steps by which events in the

               see how the material and human worlds come together and are

               the idea of an independent reality, free of human interaction,
               emerge in the first place? His answer to this question, harking
               back to the debates between Might and Right narrated by Plato,

               ``detached'' nor ``engaged''; a new approach to sociological
               knowledge production, with examples from health care.In this
               book, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak considers how the direct involvement
               of social scientists in the practices they study can lead to the
               production of sociological knowledge. Neither ``detached''
               sociological scholarship nor ``engaged'' social science, this
               new approach to sociological research brings together two
               activities often viewed as belonging to different realms:
               intervening in practices and furthering scholarly understanding
               of them. Just as the natural sciences benefited from broadening
               their scholarship from theorizing to experiment, so too could
               the social sciences. Additionally, Zuiderent-Jerak points out,
               rather than proceeding from a pre-set normative agenda,
               scholarly intervention allows for the experimental production of
               normativity. Scholars are far from detached, but still may be
               surprised by the normative outcomes of the interactions within
               the experiment.Zuiderent-Jerak illustrates situated intervention
               research with a series of examples drawn from health care. Among
               the topics addressed are patient compliance in hemophilia home
               care, the organization of oncology care and the value of
               situated standardization, the relationship between
               standardization and patient centeredness, the development of
               patient-centered pathways, value-driven and savings-driven
               approaches to the construction of health care markets, and
               multiple ontologies of safety in care for older adults. Finally,
               returning to the question of normativity in sociological
               research, Zuiderent-Jerak proposes an ethics of specificity
               according to which research adapts its sociological responses to
               the practices studied. Sociology not only has more to offer to
               the practices it studies; it also has more to learn from them.",

               cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and
               practices that have transformed not only software but also
               music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of
               practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software
               source code that is made openly and freely available through an
               unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these
               specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around
               the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of
               knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to
               discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by
               demonstrating how Free Software is a ``recursive public''---a
               public organized around the ability to build, modify, and
               maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first
               place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an
               Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in
               Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the
               technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers,
               geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case,
               he shows how their practices and way of life include not only
               the sharing of software source code but also ways of
               conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses,
               coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in
               detail how these practices came together as the Free Software
               movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how
               it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from
               Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit
               organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a

               aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of
               contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political
               significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS)
               movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details
               the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes
               that guide its production, and the political struggles through
               which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and
               patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book
               unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of
               access, and intellectual property. E. Gabriella Coleman tracks
               the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate
               manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and
               festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers
               sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these
               activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key
               ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and
               refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman
               demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or

  abstract  = "Blog Theory offers a critical theory of contemporary media.
               Furthering her account of communicative capitalism, Jodi Dean
               explores the ways new media practices like blogging and texting
               capture their users in intensive networks of enjoyment,
               production, and surveillance. Her wide-ranging and theoretically
               rich analysis extends from her personal experiences as a
               blogger, through media histories, to newly emerging social
               network platforms and applications. Set against the background
               of the economic crisis wrought by neoliberalism, the book
               engages with recent work in contemporary media theory as well as
               with thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean Baudrillard, Guy
               Debord, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj ?i?ek. Through these
               engagements, Dean defends the provocative thesis that
               reflexivity in complex networks is best understood via the
               psychoanalytic notion of the drives. She contends, moreover,
               that reading networks in terms of the drives enables us to grasp
               their real, human dimension, that is, the feelings and affects
               that embed us in the system. In remarkably clear and lucid
               prose, Dean links seemingly trivial and transitory updates from
               the new mass culture of the internet to more fundamental changes
               in subjectivity and politics. Everyday communicative
               exchanges{\~N}from blog posts to text messages{\~N}have
               widespread effects, effects that not only undermine capacities
               for democracy but also entrap us in circuits of domination.",

  abstract  = "The aesthetic and political implications of working with code as
               procedure, expression, and action. Speaking Code begins by
               invoking the ``Hello World'' convention used by programmers when
               learning a new language, helping to establish the interplay of
               text and code that runs through the book. Interweaving the voice
               of critical writing from the humanities with the tradition of
               computing and software development, in Speaking Code Geoff Cox
               formulates an argument that aims to undermine the distinctions
               between criticism and practice and to emphasize the aesthetic
               and political implications of software studies. Not reducible to
               its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability
               inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only
               interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of
               operations. Code is understood as both script and performance,
               Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language--always
               ready for action. Speaking Code examines the expressive and
               performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream
               development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the
               organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise
               of social media and their actual role in suppressing political
               expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for
               free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language
               against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues
               to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may
               seem in an era of pervasive computing.",

  abstract  = "Millions of people around the world today spend portions of
               their lives in online virtual worlds. Second Life is one of the
               largest of these virtual worlds. The residents of Second Life
               create communities, buy property and build homes, go to
               concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services,
               buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall
               in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered
               through a computer screen. At the time of its initial
               publication in 2008, Coming of Age in Second Life was the first
               book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate
               universe. Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of
               fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its
               residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally
               have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the
               so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar
               ``Tom Bukowski,'' and applied the rigorous methods of
               anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human
               life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and
               antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the
               interplay of self and group.Coming of Age in Second Life shows
               how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society.
               Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this
               book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been
               virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity
               build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as
               humanity itself. Now with a new preface in which the author
               places his book in light of the most recent transformations in
               online culture, Coming of Age in Second Life remains the classic
               ethnography of virtual worlds.",

               aspect of social life. The glowing camera screen is the lens

  abstract  = "How sharing the mundane details of daily life did not start with
               Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube but with pocket diaries, photo
               albums, and baby books.Social critiques argue that social media
               have made us narcissistic, that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
               and YouTube are all vehicles for me-promotion. In The Qualified
               Self, Lee Humphreys offers a different view. She shows that
               sharing the mundane details of our lives---what we ate for
               lunch, where we went on vacation, who dropped in for a
               visit---didn't begin with mobile devices and social media.
               People have used media to catalog and share their lives for
               several centuries. Pocket diaries, photo albums, and baby books
               are the predigital precursors of today's digital and mobile
               platforms for posting text and images. The ability to take
               selfies has not turned us into needy narcissists; it's part of a
               longer story about how people account for everyday life.
               Humphreys refers to diaries in which eighteenth-century daily
               life is documented with the brevity and precision of a tweet,
               and cites a nineteenth-century travel diary in which a young
               woman complains that her breakfast didn't agree with her.
               Diaries, Humphreys explains, were often written to be shared
               with family and friends. Pocket diaries were as mobile as
               smartphones, allowing the diarist to record life in real time.
               Humphreys calls this chronicling, in both digital and nondigital
               forms, media accounting. The sense of self that emerges from
               media accounting is not the purely statistics-driven
               ``quantified self,'' but the more well-rounded qualified self.
               We come to understand ourselves in a new way through the
               representations of ourselves that we create to be consumed.",

               finance, employment, politics, health and human services has
               undergone revolutionary change. Today, automated
               systems---rather than humans---control which neighborhoods get
               policed, which families attain needed resources, and who is
               investigated for fraud. While we all live under this new regime
               of data, the most invasive and punitive systems are aimed at the
               poor.In Automating Inequality, Virginia Eubanks systematically

               predictive risk models on poor and working-class people in
               America. The book is full of heart-wrenching and eye-opening
               stories, from a woman in Indiana whose benefits are literally
               cut off as she lays dying to a family in Pennsylvania in daily

               cutting-edge science and technology to contain, investigate,
               discipline and punish the destitute. Like the county poorhouse
               and scientific charity before them, digital tracking and
               automated decision-making hide poverty from the middle-class
               public and give the nation the ethical distance it needs to make
               inhumane choices: which families get food and which starve, who
               has housing and who remains homeless, and which families are
               broken up by the state. In the process, they weaken democracy

  abstract = "As debates about the policy and ethical implications of AI
              systems grow, it will be increasingly important to accurately
              locate who is responsible when agency is distributed in a system
              and control over an action is mediated through time and space.
              Analyzing several high-profile accidents involving complex and
              automated socio-technical systems and the media coverage that
              surrounded them, I introduce the concept of a moral crumple zone
              to describe how responsibility for an action may be misattributed
              to a human actor who had limited control over the behavior of an
              automated or autonomous system. Just as the crumple zone in a car
              is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human
              in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a
              component---accidentally or intentionally---that bears the brunt
              of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system
              malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect
              the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity
              of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human
              operator. The concept is both a challenge to and an opportunity
              for the design and regulation of human-robot systems. At stake in
              articulating moral crumple zones is not only the misattribution
              of responsibility but also the ways in which new forms of

               was first developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel
               development. It has taken the open source world by storm since
               its inception in 2005, and this book teaches you how to use it
               like a pro. Effective and well-implemented version control is a
               necessity for successful web projects, whether large or small.
               With this book you'll learn how to master the world of
               distributed version workflow, use the distributed features of
               Git to the full, and extend Git to meet your every need. Written
               by Git pros Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Pro Git (Second
               Edition) builds on the hugely successful first edition, and is
               now fully updated for Git version 2.0, as well as including an
               indispensable chapter on GitHub. It's the best book for all your
               Git needs.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTA range of scholarly work in communications,
               informatics, and media studies has identified ?entrepreneurs? as
               central to an emerging paradigm of digital labor. Drawing on
               data from a multi-year research project in the virtual world
               Second Life, I explore disability experiences of
               entrepreneurism, focusing on intersections of creativity, risk,
               and inclusion. Since its founding in 2003, Second Life has
               witnessed significant disability participation. Many such
               residents engage in forms of entrepreneurship that destabilize
               dominant understandings of digital labor. Most make little or no
               profit; some labor at a loss. Something is being articulated
               through languages and practices of entrepreneurship, something
               that challenges the ableist paradigms that still deeply
               structure both digital socialities and conceptions of
               labor.Disability is typically assumed to be incompatible with
               work, an assumption often reinforced by policies that withdraw
               benefits from disabled persons whose income exceeds a meagre
               threshold. Responses to such exclusion appear when disabled
               persons in Second Life frame ?entrepreneur? as a selfhood
               characterized by creativity and contribution, not just
               initiative and risk. In navigating structural barriers with
               regard to income and access, including affordances of the
               virtual world itself, they implicitly contest reconfigurations
               of personhood under neoliberalism, where the laboring self
               becomes framed not as a worker earning an hourly wage, but as a
               business with the ?ability? to sell services. This reveals how
               digital technology reworks the interplay of selfhood, work, and
               value ? but in ways that remain culturally specific and embedded
               in forms of inequality.",

               associated with the work of Thomas Kuhn and others. Arguing that
               every scientific concept and theory---including his own---is
               culturally conditioned, Fleck was appreciably ahead of his time.
               And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, ``Though much has occurred
               since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely
               unexploited resource.'' ``To many scientists just as to many
               historians and philosophers of science facts are things that
               simply are the case: they are discovered through properly
               passive observation of natural reality. To such views Fleck
               replies that facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the
               appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a
               social construction, a made thing. A work of transparent
               brilliance, one of the most significant contributions toward a

               In The Postgenomic Condition, Jenny Reardon critically examines
               the decade after the Human Genome Project, and the fundamental
               questions about meaning, value and justice this landmark
               achievement left in its wake. Drawing on more than a decade of
               research---in molecular biology labs, commercial startups,
               governmental agencies, and civic spaces---Reardon demonstrates
               how the extensive efforts to transform genomics from high tech
               informatics practiced by a few to meaningful knowledge
               beneficial to all exposed the limits of long-cherished liberal
               modes of knowing and governing life. Those in the American South
               challenged the value of being included in genomics when no
               hospital served their community. Ethicists and lawyers charged
               with overseeing Scottish DNA and data questioned how to develop
               a system of ownership for these resources when their capacity to
               create things of value---new personalized treatments---remained
               largely unrealized. Molecular biologists who pioneered genomics
               asked whether their practices of thinking could survive the
               deluge of data produced by the growing power of sequencing
               machines. While the media is filled with grand visions of
               precision medicine, The Postgenomic Condition shares these
               actual challenges of the scientists, entrepreneurs, policy
               makers, bioethicists, lawyers, and patient advocates who sought
               to leverage liberal democratic practices to render genomic data
               a new source of meaning and value for interpreting and caring
               for life. It brings into rich empirical focus the resulting hard
               on-the-ground questions about how to know and live on a depleted
               but data-rich, interconnected yet fractured planet, where
               technoscience garners significant resources, but deeper

               surroundsit. These include algorithms; logical structures; ways
               of thinking and doing that leak out of thedomain of logic and
               into everyday life; the value and aesthetic judgments built into
               computing;programming's own subcultures; and the tightly
               formulated building blocks that work to make, name,multiply,
               control, and interweave reality. The growing importance of
               software requires a new kind ofcultural theory that can
               understand the politics of pixels or the poetry of a loop and
               engage in themicroanalysis of everyday digital objects. The
               contributors to Software Studies are both literate incomputing
               (and involved in some way in the production of software) and
               active in making andtheorizing culture. Software Studies offers
               not only studies of software but proposes an agenda fora
               discipline that sees software as an object of study from new
               perspectives. ContributorsAlisonAdam, Wilfried Hou Je Bek,

               gender on Facebook",
  author    = "Bivens, Rena",
  abstract  = "A February 2014 iteration of Facebook?s software upgraded the
               number of options for gender identification from 2 to 58.
               Drawing on critical theoretical approaches to technology, queer
               theory, and insights from science and technology studies, this
               iteration is situated within a 10-year history of software and
               user modifications that pivot around gender. I argue that the
               gender binary has regulated Facebook?s design strategy while the
               co-existence of binary and non-binary affordances has enabled
               the company to serve both users and advertising clients
               simultaneously. Three findings are revealed: (1) an original
               programming decision to store three values for gender in
               Facebook?s database became an important fissure for non-binary
               possibilities, (2) gender became increasingly valuable over
               time, and (3) in the deep level of the database, non-binary
               users are reconfigured into a binary system. This analysis also
               exposes Facebook?s focus on authenticity as an insincere yet
               highly marketable regulatory regime.",

  abstract  = "What identity means in an algorithmic age: how it works, how our
               lives are controlled by it, and how we can resist it Algorithms
               are everywhere, organizing the near limitless data that exists
               in our world. Derived from our every search, like, click, and
               purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see,
               the information accessible to us and even who our friends are.
               These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social
               relationships in the digital and physical world, but also
               determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.
               Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and
               reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status.
               They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists.
               In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data
               collection entails more than gathering information about us.
               Entities like Google, Facebook, and the NSA also decide what
               that information means, constructing our worlds and the
               identities we inhabit in the process. We have little control
               over who we algorithmically are. Our identities are made useful
               not for us---but for someone else. Through a series of
               entertaining and engaging examples, John Cheney-Lippold draws on
               the social constructions of identity to advance a new
               understanding of our algorithmic identities. We Are Data will
               educate and inspire readers who want to wrest back some freedom
               in our increasingly surveilled and algorithmically-constructed
               world.",

               Microsoft. A secret boot block overlay is buried within a system
               ASIC. This secret boot block decrypts and verifies portions of
               an external FLASH-type ROM. The presence of the secret boot
               block is camouflaged by a decoy boot block in the external ROM.
               The code contained within the secret boot block is transferred
               to the CPU in the clear over a set of high-speed busses where it
               can be extracted using simple custom hardware. The paper
               concludes with recommendations for improving the Xbox security
               system. One lesson of this study is that the use of a
               high-performance bus alone is not a sufficient security measure,

               the googlization of minds: countless commentators condemn the
               flood of images and information that dooms us to a pathological
               attention deficit. In this new book, cultural theorist Yves
               Citton goes against the tide of these standard laments to offer
               a new perspective on the problem of attention in the digital
               age. Phrases like 'paying attention' and 'investing one's
               attention' attest to our mistaken belief that attention can be
               conceptualized in narrow economic terms. We are constantly drawn
               towards attempts to quantify and commodify attention, even down
               to counting the number of 'likes' a picture receives on Facebook
               or a video on YouTube. By contrast, Citton argues that we should
               conceptualize attention as a kind of ecology and examine how the
               many different environments to which we are exposed -- from
               advertising to literature, search engines to performance art --
               condition our attention in different ways. In a world where the
               demands on our attention are ever-increasing, this timely and
               original book will be of great interest to students and scholars
               in media and communications and in literary and cultural
               studies, and to anyone concerned about the long-term
