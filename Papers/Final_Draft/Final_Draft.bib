               in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains,

               or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and

               in everyday life, from supermarket checkout lines to airline
               flight paths. After little more than half a century since its
               initial development, computer code is extensively and intimately
               woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. From the digital
               alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that
               guides our plane in for a landing, software is shaping our
               world: it creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and
               automates existing practices, transforms social and economic
               relations, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal
               empowerment, and modes of play. In Code/Space, Rob Kitchin and
               Martin Dodge examine software from a spatial perspective,
               analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The
               production of space, they argue, is increasingly dependent on
               code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of
               code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices,
               and caf{\'e}s that are transformed into workspaces by laptops
               and wireless access. Kitchin and Dodge argue that software,
               through its ability to do work in the world, transduces space.
               Then Kitchin and Dodge develop a set of conceptual tools for
               identifying and understanding the interrelationship of software,
               space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with
               rich empirical material. And, finally, they issue a manifesto,
               calling for critical scholarship into the production and
               workings of code rather than simply the technologies it

               Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about
               machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the
               story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer
               specialists---programmers, systems analysts, and other software
               developers---who transformed the electronic computer from a
               scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern
               era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful
               and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series
               of critiques of the social and organizational impact of
               electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed

               corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society

               traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern
               American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and

               drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its
               principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the
               computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process
               driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but
               was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally

               remarkable argument for understanding the reality of science in

               Rorty as the new ``b{\^e}te noire of the science worshipers,''
               gives us his most philosophically informed book since Science in

               see how the material and human worlds come together and are

               the idea of an independent reality, free of human interaction,
               emerge in the first place? His answer to this question, harking
               back to the debates between Might and Right narrated by Plato,
               points to the real stakes in the so-called science wars: the

               ``detached'' nor ``engaged''; a new approach to sociological
               knowledge production, with examples from health care.In this
               book, Teun Zuiderent-Jerak considers how the direct involvement
               of social scientists in the practices they study can lead to the
               production of sociological knowledge. Neither ``detached''
               sociological scholarship nor ``engaged'' social science, this
               new approach to sociological research brings together two
               activities often viewed as belonging to different realms:
               intervening in practices and furthering scholarly understanding
               of them. Just as the natural sciences benefited from broadening
               their scholarship from theorizing to experiment, so too could
               the social sciences. Additionally, Zuiderent-Jerak points out,
               rather than proceeding from a pre-set normative agenda,
               scholarly intervention allows for the experimental production of
               normativity. Scholars are far from detached, but still may be
               surprised by the normative outcomes of the interactions within
               the experiment.Zuiderent-Jerak illustrates situated intervention
               research with a series of examples drawn from health care. Among
               the topics addressed are patient compliance in hemophilia home
               care, the organization of oncology care and the value of
               situated standardization, the relationship between
               standardization and patient centeredness, the development of
               patient-centered pathways, value-driven and savings-driven
               approaches to the construction of health care markets, and
               multiple ontologies of safety in care for older adults. Finally,
               returning to the question of normativity in sociological
               research, Zuiderent-Jerak proposes an ethics of specificity
               according to which research adapts its sociological responses to
               the practices studied. Sociology not only has more to offer to
               the practices it studies; it also has more to learn from them.",

               cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and
               practices that have transformed not only software but also
               music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of
               practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software
               source code that is made openly and freely available through an
               unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these
               specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around
               the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of
               knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to
               discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by
               demonstrating how Free Software is a ``recursive public''---a
               public organized around the ability to build, modify, and
               maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first
               place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an
               Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in
               Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the
               technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers,
               geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case,
               he shows how their practices and way of life include not only
               the sharing of software source code but also ways of
               conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses,
               coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in
               detail how these practices came together as the Free Software
               movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how
               it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from
               Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit
               organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a

               aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of
               contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political
               significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS)
               movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details
               the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes
               that guide its production, and the political struggles through
               which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and
               patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book
               unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of
               access, and intellectual property. E. Gabriella Coleman tracks
               the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate
               manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and
               festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers
               sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these
               activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key
               ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and
               refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman
               demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or

  abstract  = "Blog Theory offers a critical theory of contemporary media.
               Furthering her account of communicative capitalism, Jodi Dean
               explores the ways new media practices like blogging and texting
               capture their users in intensive networks of enjoyment,
               production, and surveillance. Her wide-ranging and theoretically
               rich analysis extends from her personal experiences as a
               blogger, through media histories, to newly emerging social
               network platforms and applications. Set against the background
               of the economic crisis wrought by neoliberalism, the book
               engages with recent work in contemporary media theory as well as
               with thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean Baudrillard, Guy
               Debord, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj ?i?ek. Through these
               engagements, Dean defends the provocative thesis that
               reflexivity in complex networks is best understood via the
               psychoanalytic notion of the drives. She contends, moreover,
               that reading networks in terms of the drives enables us to grasp
               their real, human dimension, that is, the feelings and affects
               that embed us in the system. In remarkably clear and lucid
               prose, Dean links seemingly trivial and transitory updates from
               the new mass culture of the internet to more fundamental changes
               in subjectivity and politics. Everyday communicative
               exchanges{\~N}from blog posts to text messages{\~N}have
               widespread effects, effects that not only undermine capacities
               for democracy but also entrap us in circuits of domination.",

  abstract  = "The aesthetic and political implications of working with code as
               procedure, expression, and action. Speaking Code begins by
               invoking the ``Hello World'' convention used by programmers when
               learning a new language, helping to establish the interplay of
               text and code that runs through the book. Interweaving the voice
               of critical writing from the humanities with the tradition of
               computing and software development, in Speaking Code Geoff Cox
               formulates an argument that aims to undermine the distinctions
               between criticism and practice and to emphasize the aesthetic
               and political implications of software studies. Not reducible to
               its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability
               inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only
               interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of
               operations. Code is understood as both script and performance,
               Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language--always
               ready for action. Speaking Code examines the expressive and
               performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream
               development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the
               organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise
               of social media and their actual role in suppressing political
               expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for
               free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language
               against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues
               to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may
               seem in an era of pervasive computing.",

               Virtually Human",
  author    = "Boellstorff, Tom",
  abstract  = "Millions of people around the world today spend portions of
               their lives in online virtual worlds. Second Life is one of the
               largest of these virtual worlds. The residents of Second Life
               create communities, buy property and build homes, go to
               concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services,
               buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall
               in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered
               through a computer screen. At the time of its initial
               publication in 2008, Coming of Age in Second Life was the first
               book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate
               universe. Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of
               fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its
               residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally
               have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the
               so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar
               ``Tom Bukowski,'' and applied the rigorous methods of
               anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human
               life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and
               antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the
               interplay of self and group.Coming of Age in Second Life shows
               how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society.
               Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this
               book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been
               virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity
               build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as
               humanity itself. Now with a new preface in which the author
               places his book in light of the most recent transformations in
               online culture, Coming of Age in Second Life remains the classic
               ethnography of virtual worlds.",

               has remade our world.With the rise of the smart phone and social
               media, cameras have become ubiquitous, infiltrating nearly every
               aspect of social life. The glowing camera screen is the lens
               through which many of seek to communicate our experience. But
               our thinking about photography has been slow to catch-up; this
               major fixture of everyday life is still often treated in the
               terms of art or journalism. In The Social Photo, social theorist
               Nathan Jurgenson develops bold new ways of understanding
               photography in the age of social media and the new kinds of
               images that have emerged: the selfie, the faux-vintage photo,
               the self-destructing image, the food photo. Jurgenson shows how

  abstract  = "How sharing the mundane details of daily life did not start with
               Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube but with pocket diaries, photo
               albums, and baby books.Social critiques argue that social media
               have made us narcissistic, that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
               and YouTube are all vehicles for me-promotion. In The Qualified
               Self, Lee Humphreys offers a different view. She shows that
               sharing the mundane details of our lives---what we ate for
               lunch, where we went on vacation, who dropped in for a
               visit---didn't begin with mobile devices and social media.
               People have used media to catalog and share their lives for
               several centuries. Pocket diaries, photo albums, and baby books
               are the predigital precursors of today's digital and mobile
               platforms for posting text and images. The ability to take
               selfies has not turned us into needy narcissists; it's part of a
               longer story about how people account for everyday life.
               Humphreys refers to diaries in which eighteenth-century daily
               life is documented with the brevity and precision of a tweet,
               and cites a nineteenth-century travel diary in which a young
               woman complains that her breakfast didn't agree with her.
               Diaries, Humphreys explains, were often written to be shared
               with family and friends. Pocket diaries were as mobile as
               smartphones, allowing the diarist to record life in real time.
               Humphreys calls this chronicling, in both digital and nondigital
               forms, media accounting. The sense of self that emerges from
               media accounting is not the purely statistics-driven
               ``quantified self,'' but the more well-rounded qualified self.
               We come to understand ourselves in a new way through the
               representations of ourselves that we create to be consumed.",
