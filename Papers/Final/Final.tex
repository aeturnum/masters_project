   \section*{It's Software's World, We Just Live in it}
   Software worms its way into every nook and cranny of our world. Part of this paper is based on work I did \textit{in} software, but the paper itself has also moved through software. Systems that were once realized physically have, for reasons beyond the scope of my work, moved into software. This means that academics use software to compose and share their ideas, while farmers fight companies for access to the software that runs their tractors \citep{Koebler2017-dt}. Many of the roles that software has stepped into are not new. This project and paper are not founded on the idea that software allows anything that is unique per-se. I do believe, however, that software (and the artifacts that emerge out of the software process) have particular material qualities that change how they are in the world and the way they impact the world \citep{Mackenzie2006-hb, Kitchin2011-af}. This work began by trying to understand how the ideas of situated knowledges and strong objectivity can inform the creation of software \citep{Harding1992-od,Haraway1988-nh}. Software, like all material things, encodes the perspectives and assumptions of its makers. But what use is it, really, to point out that the assumptions of Software makers remain in the things they produce? I hoped to find a path from finding and detailing perspectives encoded in software to a direct intervention at the software level \citep{Zuiderent-Jerak2015-go}. My approach assumed that details in the material qualities of software that would be useful in making a situated intervention into the perspectives encoded into it. Ultimately, it was the material aspects of how software exists differently for different stakeholders in its creation and use that would come to dominate that rest of the project.

   I believe the limits to applying situated knowledges to software lie within the blackbox of software itself \citep{Latour1999-ui}. It turns out that software doesn't just look different

   This state of affairs can lead to a kind of flattening of software, where the real material qualities of the object itself are obscured and black-boxed by the social practice around the object \citep{Latour1999-ui}
